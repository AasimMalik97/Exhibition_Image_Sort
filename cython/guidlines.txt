Guidelines for Tuning
Small Datasets (<5,000 rows)

    comparison_limit: Use higher values (e.g., 30 or 50).
    lookahead: Use higher values (e.g., 10 or 20).
    Why: The smaller size allows for more exhaustive comparisons without significant runtime penalties.

Medium Datasets (5,000 - 50,000 rows)

    comparison_limit: Moderate values (e.g., 20).
    lookahead: Moderate values (e.g., 5 or 10).
    Why: Striking a balance between runtime and accuracy becomes essential.

Large Datasets (>50,000 rows)

    comparison_limit: Lower values (e.g., 10).
    lookahead: Lower values (e.g., 3 or 5).
    Why: Runtime optimization is critical, and small sacrifices in accuracy may be acceptable.
